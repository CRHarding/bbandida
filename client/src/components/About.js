			  <p>
				Jessica Dusel has been honing her craft for over two decades. 
				Originally inspired and taught as a child by her grandmothers and 
				sewing teacher Florence Peck, she furthered her knowledge in adulthood 
				through an internship with Jess Audey at the Macyâ€™s fashion incubator, and then graduating from Columbia in 2010.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Launching BB&IDA in 2012, Jessica finally began to really show her 
				individual sense of style and client relations. Cultivating an avid 
				following in Chicago at trade shows and alt markets, Jessica identified 
				her customer base and started to build her brand. In manufacturing she 
				focuses on durable easy to wear pieces made with luxe and eco friendly 
				fabrics for women of all sizes. In her bespoke items she entertains a larger 
				degree of whimsy and personalization, truly working with her client to ensure 
				the piece is not just a representation of their requirements but also a garment that showcases her style and ingenuity.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Moving to a new home and studio in 2017, Jessica continues to create custom wear 
				and release capsule collections in the greater Chicago area.
