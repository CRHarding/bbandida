              Jessica Dusel has been honing her craft for over two decades.
              Originally inspired and taught as a child by her grandmothers and
              sewing teacher Florence Peck, she furthered her knowledge in adulthood
              through an internship with Jess Audey at the Macyâ€™s fashion incubator,
              and then graduating from Columbia in 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
              Launching BB&IDA in 2012, Jessica finally began to really show her
              individual sense of style and client relations. Cultivating an avid
              following in Chicago at trade shows and alt markets, Jessica
              identified her customer base and started to build her brand. In
              manufacturing she focuses on durable easy to wear pieces made with
              luxe and eco friendly fabrics for women of all sizes. In her bespoke
              items she entertains a larger degree of whimsy and personalization,
              truly working with her client to ensure the piece is not just a
              representation of their requirements but also a garment that showcases
              her style and ingenuity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving to a new home and studio in 2017, Jessica continues to create
              custom wear and release capsule collections in the greater Chicago
              area.
